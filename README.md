C Calculator Program

This is a simple calculator written in C that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

Requirements:
- A C compiler
- Standard C library (`stdio.h`)

Compilation:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the C source file (`calculator.c`) is saved.
3. Compile the program using a C compiler.

Usage:
1. After compiling, run the program.
2. The program will prompt you to:
   - Enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
   - Enter two numbers for the operation.
3. The result of the operation will be displayed. If the user attempts to divide by zero, an error message will be shown.

Example:
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): + 
Enter two numbers: 5 3 
Result: 8.00

Error Handling:
- If an invalid operator is entered, the program will notify the user.
- If division by zero is attempted, an error message will be displayed.
